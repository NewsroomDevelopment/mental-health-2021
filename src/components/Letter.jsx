        Dear readers, Columbia can often feel like a pressure cooker. It accepts
        some of the most competitive applicants in the world, many who have
        never been encouraged to slow down and take a breath, many who were
        always encouraged to do the opposite. With finals approaching, we wanted
        to not only give you a better look at what mental health looks like on
        Columbia’s campus but also provide you with some tips, tricks, and
        resources to make this very stressful time less anxiety-inducing. Within
        this edition, some articles deal with topics of disordered eating,
        depression, and other mental health topics. Please exercise caution
        while reading these articles. These pieces reflect on resident advisors’
        struggles in finding community within their living situations as they
        simultaneously feel unprepared to deal with their residents’ mental
        health struggles. They discuss the high-stress culture of disordered
        eating in the dance world, how dining at Columbia and Barnard dining
        halls is difficult for students with histories of disordered eating and
        eating disorders, and how cross-country and track teams can produce a
        culture of disordered eating. However, this edition also aims to
        highlight those who are working to raise mental health awareness and
        cultivate positive mindsets. Read through this edition to find members
        of the Columbia community hoping to destigmatize speaking up about
        struggling with mental health, at-home bakers using their hobby to
        de-stress and take care of themselves, and students finding community
        through Columbia Confessions in times of need. We hope that in reading
        their stories, you feel encouraged to prioritize your own mental health
        and that of others. At Spectator, we have focused our efforts this past
        year on changing the way that we grapple with mental health and burnout
        among our staff. We have implemented a reasonable end time for
        production nights; expanded our use of content warnings; elected our
        first head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; established a
        regularly-meeting DEI committee; and voted in new policies for our
        Community Standards. However, there remains more that we can do—both as
        members of Spectator and Columbia students—to combat the stress culture
        that is so pervasive within the Columbia community. As our tenures on
        Spectator’s corporate board come to a close, we wanted to thank you for
        a year of reading and learning with us. Now, it is time for all of us to
        slow down and take a breath before the end of the year ramps up. We
        promise you deserve it. Wishing you a meaningful end to the semester,
        Sarah Braka, Editor in Chief Elizabeth Karpen, Managing Editor
